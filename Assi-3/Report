Q1)Compare and contrast the representation of a point in the cartesian
co-ordinate system and in the polar co-ordinate system

Sol:

Representation:
	Cartisian co-ordinate system is represtented by X & Y axis which are fixed and perpendicular to each other.
	while Polar is represented by perpendicular axis R & Theta which are can change .
	
	Also range of x & y is whole number line where as in polar co-ordinate system range of R is whole number line where as range of theta is from [0,2*PI]
